        <h2 id="foreword">Foreword - Motivation</h2>
        <p>Hi! I know that many of you don’t even notice this section, but I would appreciate it if you could read it. Thanks! :-)</p>
        <p>In this mini-book, you will(hopefully) learn about different neural network structures. By the end of the book, I hope you
            also will have a solid conceptual understanding of how neural networks function.<p><aside><p>NOTE: This book is not written by a data
            scientist, please do contact me if you find mistakes that should be fixed, thanks! I also welcome <a rel="noopener" href="https://forms.gle/U9yQyfQcAQZ8mDRF9" target="_blank">suggestions and tips</a> that
            could be added to different sections of the book. See the contact for more information!</p></aside><p>I will briefly go through some necessary
            formulas and equations, but will mainly stick to broad definitions that are comprehendible to even middle school students(I’ll try!).
            Some topics are well beyond those taught in middle school, so you may want to look at more thorough and step-by-step walkthroughs
            on the topics on platforms like <a rel="noopener" href="https://khanacademy.org/" target="_blank">Khan Academy</a>.</p>
        <p>As you go through this book, you will also encounter several different projects and real-world problems that I will walk you through
            and solve. I highly recommend you take a try at solving them beforehand! Solutions that I give may not be the best and most state-of-the-art,
            so you can also try and tweak it a bit to make it better! I will try to add some optimizations to the code to make it faster and more efficient
            and give you a summary of what state-of-the-art methods data scientists now use. All code in this book is either pseudocode, Python(when used, an identical
            Java program is also given), and Java, so you should be able to roughly interpret it if you have learned any C-like programming languages! You don’t need to learn one right away to continue
            reading either… I provide detailed explanations of each line of code. You can also find it all on <a rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/JC-ProgJava/Building-Neural-Networks-From-Scratch" target="_blank">GitHub</a>(with this book).</p>
        <p>Now that I have given an introduction to what you will learn, I should probably answer an impending question that will some time or later come to mind: “why did you write this book? Surely you didn’t do it just for the sake of
            fun?” I admit, there was a motivation behind it. Nowadays, it is hard to find a detailed (and free) guide to neural networks that explains it all very well. I wrote it, partly also to get a more intuitive understanding of
            the way neural networks work myself: I had only gotten interested in the subject in March 2020, and yet hadn’t been able to find a tutorial that explained it all in detail and provided programs that required no libraries
            (libraries just do all the work for you, you don’t get a good comprehensive understanding on what it does). So, I wrote this, to store all my personal experiences in words, and to make your life in learning about neural networks
            easier. <a rel="noopener" href="https://forms.gle/s66SvotPBjvhVY4H7" target="_blank">Thank me later</a> :). People always think that writing the book is the hardest part of the entire process, but I believe that finding materials and sources or references is even harder. Stating information in a readable and
            easy-to-understand way was probably the most challenging part I tried to accomplish in this book.</p>
        <p>On another note, this book took several hundred hours to write and consists of 20609 words. What I am trying to get at is that it took a very long time to write this, so I would appreciate it if all uses(if any) of this book in
            other forms are attributed and properly cited/credited. It would also be great if this piece of writing could be attributed to the correct authors and not “stolen” or plagiarised. I provide a <a rel="noopener" href="#citation">citation reference</a> which you can
            look at. I don’t use any license, but the limitations for use of this book are also listed there. Any references or sources for images, definitions, or phrases/ideologies are also cited on the <a rel="noopener" href="references.html">references</a> page. If you feel that your work may have been
            incorrectly cited or misused, you can contact me and I will see to it that we can come to a resolution.</p>
        <p>Finally, let’s end on a happier note:</p>
        <p>Start reading!</p><br>
