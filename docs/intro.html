        <h2>Chapter 1 - Introduction</h2>
        <h3 class="quote">“Success in creating AI would be the biggest event in human history. Unfortunately,
            it might also be the last, unless we learn how to avoid the risks.”<br>– Stephen Hawking</h3>
        <p>In this introduction, I hope to give clear and coherent answers to a few common questions about
            machine learning, artificial intelligence, and alike areas in data science.</p>
        <h3 id="def-machine-learning">What is machine learning?</h3>
        <p>The simple answer is, it is an algorithm that a machine uses to be able to give a correct output
            for a given set of inputs. Expanding on that, it is one that identifies possible similarities in
            a given set of inputs and outputs and uses it to classify new inputs that haven’t been seen before.</p>
        <p>Machine learning can be separated into three categories: supervised and unsupervised learning; and reinforcement
            learning. Supervised learning requires all data to be labeled, which the computer uses to learn from its
            mistakes and get better. Unsupervised learning does the opposite, given a set of data with no labels whatsoever,
            a computer identifies characteristics commonly found among a cluster of the data and uses this to identify or
            classify different sets of inputs. And lastly, reinforcement learning, which makes a machine learn by “rewarding”
            it when a correct or ideal interpretation is made.</p>
        <p>Here, what I mean by <em>labeling</em> is being marked with an answer. For example, supervised learning requires a
            picture of a cat to be labeled “this is a cat”, and for a picture of a dog to be labeled “this is a dog”. This form
            of learning requires an extensive amount of work for humans, who need to manually label an entire collection of images,
            to get a computer to classify different inputs. This is why people will tell you “machine learning is all about the
            data you have”. This is not always entirely true. You can achieve state-of-the-art results(or nearly) with a small dataset.
            So, I usually say “machine learning is all about the choice of hyperparameters and methods used”. I mention another word
            <em>hyperparameter</em>, which just means a parameter that controls a set of parameters. You will get a more thorough
            definition in later chapters.</p>
        <p>You may also wonder about the applications of each category of machine learning. Supervised learning is usually used for
            classification or regression problems. For example, classifying digits or predicting costs of houses by the number of rooms,
            location, etc. Unsupervised learning is usually used for identifying unique features in data. This may mean trying to find
            a correlation between two seemingly unrelated topics or ideas. Reinforcement learning typically occurs in artificial intelligence
            in the games industry/area. For example, you could train a computer to play Go, Chess, Snake, Super Mario, etc. with reinforcement
            learning.</p>
        <h3 id="works">How does machine learning work?</h3>
        <p>People tend to assume that only professional data scientists can apply machine learning to different areas in the modern world and
            assume that the topic is extremely deep-reaching and complex. This is false. For example, I am not a professional data scientist,
            yet I understand various techniques in machine learning relatively well. Machine learning is just a series of steps that a computer
            takes that turn any problem into one that has numbers. As you may know, computers are not good at evaluating <em>anything</em> other than numbers.
            All information is stored as 0s and 1s, which is why people state that “computers will never have emotions”. This series of steps consist of:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Gathering Data</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Gather relevant data that can be used to predict an output with a set of inputs.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Preparing Data</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Make sure data is relevant and in the same format so that when the computer learns with the data, it doesn’t mistake certain characteristics
                    as a feature. For example, make sure that images of digits are all centered so that the computer doesn’t determine a digit by location on the image.</li>
                <li>Resizing images to be proportional</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Modeling</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Choosing an appropriate architecture/model for the particular problem</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Training</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Forward propagation</li>
                <li>Backward propagation/learning</li>
                <li>Error calculation</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Evaluation</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Validation/testing</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Prevent overfitting or underfitting, where features are too narrow(starting
                        to be biased to the training dataset) or too broad/abstract(not determining
                        key features, but small characteristics), more will be said of this topic.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <li>Hyperparameter adjustment</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Adjust hyperparameters to get the best result possible</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Learning rate</li>
                    <li>Activation function</li>
                    <li>Optimization</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <li>Prediction/Deployment</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Interpret new inputs using the trained model!</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <p>This may all sound like gibberish to you, it’s fine! By the end of this
            book, you should have a solid fundamental understanding of each of these unique peculiar terms!</p>
        <h3 id="summary">Chapter Summary</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Machine learning is simply a set of algorithms a computer runs to learn characteristics from a
                given set of inputs, which enables them to classify sets of unseen input data.</li><br>
            <li>Machine learning consists of three categories: supervised learning, unsupervised learning,
                and reinforcement learning.</li><br>
            <li>Supervised learning requires data to be labeled. Common uses for supervised learning are
                for classification(recognizing) or regression(estimating/predicting a value).</li><br>
            <li>Unsupervised learning does not require data to be labeled. Uses for unsupervised learning
                are to identify features that appear in data, often finding a correlation between two
                seemingly unrelated factors.</li><br>
            <li>Reinforcement learning embraces a reward-based learning system, where the computer is
                “rewarded” when it achieves something and “penalized” when failing to achieve a goal.
                Common uses for reinforcement learning are in game-based AI, for example, Chess, Go,
                Snake, etc.</li><br>
            <li>Labeling is the action of putting the correct answer onto data so that a computer can learn from its mistakes.</li><br>
            <li>Machine learning consists of seven main steps:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Gathering Data</li>
                <li>Preparing Data</li>
                <li>Modeling</li>
                <li>Training</li>
                <li>Evaluation</li>
                <li>Hyperparameter adjustment</li>
                <li>Prediction/Deployment</li>
            </ul>
