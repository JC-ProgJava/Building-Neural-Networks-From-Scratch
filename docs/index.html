        <p>In this mini-book, you will(hopefully) learn about different neural network structures. By the end of the book,
            I hope you also will have a solid conceptual understanding of how neural networks function.</p><aside><p>NOTE:
            This book is not written by a data scientist, please do contact me if you find mistakes that should be fixed,
            thanks! I also welcome <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc-JrIBxMqlcOyLN6rgmhH5AVhNEj7LlJPhQTQk9zrbYG4Uhg/viewform" target="_blank">suggestions and tips</a>
            that could be added to different sections of the book. See the contact
            for more information!</p></aside><p>I will briefly go through some necessary formulas and equations, but will mainly
            stick to broad definitions that are comprehendible to even middle school students(I’ll try!). Some topics are well
            beyond those taught in middle school, so you may want to look at more thorough and step-by-step walkthroughs on the
            topics on platforms like <a href="https://khanacademy.org/" target="_blank">Khan Academy</a>.
            As you go through this book, you will also encounter several different projects and real-world problems that I will
            walk you through and solve. I highly recommend you take a try at solving them beforehand! Solutions that I give may
            not be the best and most state-of-the-art, so you can also try and tweak it a bit to make it better! I will try to
            add some optimizations to the code to make it faster and more efficient and give you a summary of what state-of-the-art
            methods data scientists now use. All code in this book is either pseudocode or written in Java, so you should be able to
            roughly interpret it if you have learned any C-like programming languages! You don’t need to learn one right away to
            continue reading either… I provide detailed explanations of each line of code. You can also find it all on
            <a href="https://github.com/JC-ProgJava/Building-Neural-Networks-From-Scratch" target="_blank">GitHub</a> (with this book).</p>
