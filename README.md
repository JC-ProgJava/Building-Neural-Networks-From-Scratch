- [Demos](https://jc-progjava.github.io/Building-Neural-Networks-From-Scratch/demos.html) webpage! 🚀

26 July 2021
- Fixed inconsistencies between print and web version.
- Renamed and added new chapter ideas to web. 🚀

24 July 2021

- Revised Chapter 3 - Neural Networks and Learning
  - Now includes extensive guide to the delta rule
  - More into derivatives (i.e., Chain Rule)
  - Step by step guide to deriving the delta rule.
- Renamed "Optimization" chapter to "Optimizers"
- Fixed some figure naming inconsistencies.
- Adjust spacing of ordered list in Data Preprocessing and Augmentation chapter.

19 July 2021

- Finished Chapter 7 Data Preprocessing & Augmentation. 🙂
- Pushed Chapter 7 to the web. 🚀
- Added "Data_Preprocessing_Augmentation" code folder to Github.

9 May 2021

- Combined chapters Data Augmentation (Chpt. 11) and Image Preprocessing (Chpt. 7) into Chpt. 7 (Image Preprocessing and Data Augmentation)
- Renamed chapter 7 to "Data Preprocessing & Augmentation"
- Created a separate version of the references list. It is more readable than the bibliography, and is for readers that are interested in how the book was made and want to read more on topics covered in the book.
- Started on Chapter 7 and opened issue #14.
- Added a page on fonts used in the book (Source Code Pro for code and Amiri for text. Both are under the Open Font License [OFL] and were obtained through Google Fonts)

- Reworked front page.
- Reworked syntax highlighting scheme in web version.
- Header on web version now collapses after scrolling to enhance reading experience. The header appears once users scroll up slightly.
- New chapter idea (Chapter 11 - Convolutional Neural Networks)
- Changed syntax highlighting architecture to [this](https://github.com/JC-ProgJava/SyntaxHighlighter) (made by me! 🙂).
- Fixed #14, #17, #19, #23, #24.
- Modified font size in mobile viewports.
